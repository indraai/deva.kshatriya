A Kshatriya who, while he protects his people, is defied by foes, be they equal in strength, or stronger, or weaker, must not shrink from battle, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas. Not to turn back in battle, to protect the people, to honour the Brahmanas, is the best means for a Kshatriya to secure happiness. But the Kshatriya who is conquered in battle, while he turns back in fear, takes upon himself all the sin of his master, whatever it may be. The highest duty of a Kshatriya is to protect the people, for the Kshatriya who enjoys the rewards, just mentioned, is bound to discharge that duty.",
